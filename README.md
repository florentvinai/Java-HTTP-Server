# Java-HTTP-Server
creation and development of a Java HTTP server. The aim is to provide a robust foundation for building web applications and services using Java.

Introduction:
This repository serves as a platform for the creation and development of a Java HTTP server. The aim is to provide a robust foundation for building web applications and services using Java.

Key Features:

HTTP Server Implementation: The core feature of this repository is the implementation of an HTTP server in Java. This server will be capable of handling HTTP requests and responses, making it suitable for serving web content and APIs.

Routing and Request Handling: The HTTP server will include functionality for routing incoming requests to the appropriate handlers based on their URLs. This allows for the implementation of different endpoints and services within the server.

Concurrency and Scalability: Efforts will be made to ensure that the HTTP server is designed to handle concurrent connections efficiently, allowing for scalability and improved performance under load.

Customization and Extension: The repository will provide hooks and interfaces for extending and customizing the behavior of the HTTP server. This allows developers to adapt the server to their specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into their projects.

Technologies Used:

Java: The primary programming language used for developing the HTTP server.
HTTP Protocol: Implementation of the HTTP protocol for communication between clients and the server.
Networking APIs: Utilization of Java's networking APIs for handling socket connections and HTTP communication.
Concurrency Utilities: Integration of Java's concurrency utilities for managing concurrent requests and improving server performance.
